✈️ AI-Powered Travel Planner
This project is an interactive AI-driven travel planner that generates personalized travel itineraries based on natural language input. Powered by OpenAI's GPT model, the planner understands travel preferences such as destination, duration, budget, interests, and group size to return a day-wise itinerary along with estimated costs and tailored suggestions.

🧠 Key Features
Natural Language Input: Users simply describe their dream trip (e.g., "luxury honeymoon in Santorini for 7 days, love food and sunsets, budget $6000").

AI-Powered Itinerary Generation: The OpenAI API interprets the request and generates detailed daily plans, complete with activity descriptions and costs.

Preference Extraction: Extracts and displays structured preferences such as destination, style, interests, group size, and budget.

AI Travel Insights: Provides smart summaries and tips based on the travel profile and selected destination.

Support for Multiple AI Modes: Choose between OpenAI, Hugging Face models, or a rule-based fallback.
